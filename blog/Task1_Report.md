### First of all, why would i even think of migrating from PostgreSQL to some Tarantool database ?

Tarantool is a NoSQL database, that represents as a database that contain capabilities of a cache and a consisten storage. It's open-source on [GitHub](https://github.com/tarantool), and it's being built by some enthusiasts from Mail.Ru Group and other companies. It is being represent as a modern solution for application's storage - it could return data as fast, as a InMemory cache would do,  and it also could contain data more consistently because of supporing features of RDBMS - such as ACID transactions, replication, indexing, functions/procedures, server-side scripting and even full support of SQL queries (support of SQLite queries, actually, as i have understood from [one of the reports](https://www.highload.ru/moscow/2018/abstracts/4271) further.

It is being represented as replacement of PostgreSQL and Redis pairing, which i am currently using in my applications. I have found the [report](https://habr.com/ru/company/mailru/blog/279999/) from Mail.ru Group on Habr.com  about the usage of Tarantool in high load projects, so i have understood that switching to Tarantool could be useful for applications i am building myself, too.
As i have known what a Tarantool database is, i have decided i could write some kind of migrator from PostgreSQL to Tarantool,  and i have began my search for an existing solution through the Internet. At that point, searching straight forward for a PostgreSQL to Tarantool migratior left me empty-handed - there were not such a tool.

As there were no existing solution, i have began a search for something that would help me write a migrator. Since i am a C# developer, i started with a search for a connector or some kind of an ORM to Tarantool from a .NET application. What i found was a report of using a Tarantool in a .NET application that run under Windows. That was a success - i received the basics of how to install and start Tarantool on Windows (which will not run on Windows straight forward, as you might have already understood), and a connector, that is still in development - which is great, because Tarantool is also under development - an update of a database or an API to it could bring breaking changes! 

As a .NET developer, i work on Windows machines most of my time, and i don't have an operational Unix-based machine under my shoulder. Report gave me two opportunities of installing Tarantool on Windows. First of them was that i run Tarantool from a Docker container, which required a Windows 10 Pro edition installed, which i don't have, so I gave this case up straight away and moved to a second one, which was to use a Windows Subsystem for Linux - basically it is me enabling developer mode in Windows, and installing a Ubuntu distribution kit - that gave me an operationalal Bash directly on Windows. 

After installing Tarantool, i've completed a small pre-installed tutorial of how to use Tarantool - since Tarantool is written in Lua language - direct console query must also be on Lua (could be an SQL query, as i've understood further).
After "Getting Started with Tarantool" step, i rotated my attention to a connector from a report. It's called progaudi.tarantool (previously Tarantool.CSharp, but they changed the name so it won't confuse developers on F# and Visual Basic language), it's also an open-source project on [GitHub](https://github.com/progaudi/progaudi.tarantool).

In this repo I also found a small demo, of a basics of using the library. This demo was a bit outdated - because connector is in development - so i have managed to find a more fresh report - from the DotNext 2018 conference. The developer of a connector has represented his library in this report. [YouTube vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7KTa9F6DSI&list=PLtWrKx3nUGBfx-TBNymPp3WSpeHp7vxj9&index=17&t=0s), [and the raw presentation](https://assets.ctfassets.net/9n3x4rtjlya6/42P2X4ZwRi64SMyiGOoEYE/e375b1847c59016e75b95d3d1a13f359/Anatoliy_Popov_Ispolzovaniye_Tarantool_v_.NET-proyektakh.pdf.).

After some research on [documentation](https://www.tarantool.io/en/doc/2.2/) of Tarantool and listening to the report on connector mentioned above, I have managed to implement simple service that provide a CRUD operations to Tarantool for generic model from a .NET application. I host it [here](https://github.com/d4n0n-myself/postgres-tarantool-tester). It still needs work - the models are imaginary and could not be covering all posibilities of Tarantool; this service does not ensure that Tarantool has the structures of models in it - i have written a little startup file in Lua to create initial structures with a Tarantool initiliazation to support my development of CRUD operations. I intend to use this service as a base for comparison of PostgreSQL and Tarantool.
